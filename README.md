OpenRhythm is an open-sourced game engine for easily creating rhythm games. It is currently in alpha and features a small demonstration project. It is written entirely in C using the SDL2 library. As development continues, users will be able to create levels and customize art assets without having to touch any of the C code.

The engine currently features a custom plain text .lvl level file format. 

The current focus of development is moving away from hard-coded level selection towards dynamic level listing & selection.
